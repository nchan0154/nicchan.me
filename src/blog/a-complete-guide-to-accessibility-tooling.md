I'm honored to have published an article on Smashing Magazine! As a little editors note, I'm really excited to have opportunities to write long form content and publish them in places where they may have more reach. This blog will still be updated, but content here is likely to have more personal opinions and musings on web development, or dive into niche topics rather than be fully instructional. Thank you for sticking with me on this journey!
