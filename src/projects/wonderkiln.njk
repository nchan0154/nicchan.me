  After working with <a href="https://www.wonderkiln.com/">Wonderkiln</a> for over a year, I was thrilled to finally get the opportunity to build out the new site! The site utilizes Grav as the content management system and features <a href="https://medium.com/outsystems-experts/flip-your-60-fps-animations-flip-em-good-372281598865">buttery smooth</a> CSS animations, along with page transitions with the help of Barba.js.
