Being a blog for web developers, we got to use all the latest hot tech tips ðŸ”¥ for improving performance.
Amongst other things, the WebPageTest blog uses responsive images powered by Cloudinary,
with fixed aspect ratios for a jank-free loading experience and perfect CLS score,
paginated categories, tags and authors (a feature not present in 11ty by default).

and I'm grateful to have picked up a few tips and tricks on performance from working with the incredibly talented WebPageTest team at Catchpoint!
